### [Hi-Tech Ramen](https://hi-tech-ramen.herokuapp.com/) emulates a Menu at a Ramen bar. Its intention is to allow a user to choose between different types of ramen styles including what kind of soup base, toppings, or a choice of meats. This is a practice application for myself to later further create a much more advanced ramen bar with a ton of different options and user preferences!
